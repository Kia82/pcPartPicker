This project focused on a super simplfied version of PCPartPicker, a website that empowers PC builders by offering a vast database of components and compatibility checks.

Here is what it offers Key Functionalities:

Advanced Search Capabilities: This project aims to develop advanced search filters or tools that leverage PCPartPicker's data. These tools will enable users to perform more granular component selection based on specific criteria beyond what the current PCPartPicker interface offers. (Provide more specifics about your search enhancements here. For instance, will it allow filtering by price ranges, performance benchmarks, or specific features?)
Complex Query Support: By building upon PCPartPicker's existing search functionalities, this project strives to enable users to construct even more intricate search queries. This will allow them to refine their component selection process to a greater degree. (Describe how your project expands on complex queries. Will it involve user-defined filters, combining multiple criteria, or other functionalities?)
Benefits:

Streamlined Part Selection: The enhanced search features developed in this project will allow PC builders to find the perfect components for their needs more efficiently.
Greater Control and Customization: Users will gain more control over their component selection process through the ability to create highly specific searches.
Improved User Experience: By simplifying and refining the search experience, this project aims to make PCPartPicker an even more valuable resource for PC enthusiast
